Secure Patterns for Internet CrEdentials

## Description 
There is a need to more clearly document the issuer, holder, and verifier model across various work IETF, ISO, W3C, and other SDOs.  
This need particularly arises in use cases for credentials that do not involve human-in-the-loop interactions.
Based on these use cases, there is a need to clearly define message formats and supporting mechanisms.  
Additionally, multiple groups at the IETF need a clear definition for what architectures might exist and should be leveraged for certain use cases, and to identify where there are gaps or new architectural concepts that need to be defined.

This repository is a collection of documents related to this proposed working group.
