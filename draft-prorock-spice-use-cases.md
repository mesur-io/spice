.# Abstract

This document describes various use cases related to credential exchange
in a three party model (issuer, holder, verifier). These use cases aid
in the identification of which Secure Patterns for Internet CrEdentials
(SPICE) are most in need of specification or detailed documentation.

# SPICE Use Cases

# Introduction

There are several expanding use cases and common patterns that motivate the working group and broader community, including:

- Use of microcredentials, particularly in education
- Digitization of physical supply chain credentials in multiple jurisdictions
  - CBOR credentials
  - High volume with system to system exchange of credentions
  - both regulatory data as well as business driven information
- IoT, Control Systems, and Critical Infrastructure related Credentials
- Credentials related to authenticity and provenance, especially of digital media
- Offline exchange (in person) of credentials that may have been internet issued
- Embedding of credentials in other data formats
- Digital Wallet Initiatives
- Selective disclosure with CBOR
